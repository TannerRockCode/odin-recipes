    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 angus burger patty</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 slice of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 avocado sliced</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat separate pan to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Once pan is heated, spray olive oil to prevent egg from sticking, and then place unscrambled raw egg on to pan.</li>
        <li>Let cook for 5 minutes and turn off heat. Leave pan lid on for another 3 minutes to cook the top of egg until the egg yolk is covered in a light layer of cooked egg white. Then place on covered warming plate to prevent egg from going cold while the rest of burger is prepared.</li>
        <li>Heat grilling surface to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Place burger onto grilling surface and grind 1/4 teaspoon of fresh pepper onto top of burger.</li>
        <li>Cook burger for 6-8 minutes, flipping the burger every two minutes on grilling surface to ensure even cooking on both sides.</li>
        <li>While burger is cooking put pretzel bun into toaster to toast the pretzel buns.</li>
        <li>Remove burger from grilling surface and place on pretzel bun.</li>
        <li>Gently remove sunny side up egg from pan and place on top of burger meat.</li>
        <li>Place cheddar cheese slice on top of sunny side up egg.</li>
        <li>Cut 1/4 of an avocado and slice thinly. Place the avocado slices on top of burger.</li>
        <li>Place the top of pretzel bun on top of avocado and the burger is ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
